                    <p class="main-text">The world is desperate for women to step up and take their place. To be represented in boardrooms and beyond. To be appreciated for all they do – in families, in society and in the workplace.

                    This Women’s History Month, join us in acknowledging today’s female trailblazers. They’re not always the women you see featured in the media. Often they’re everyday women, just like you, quietly doing amazing things.

Some of us will benefit, of course, but others might be left behind. So, what will the future of technology look like? Who will define it, and how will it impact our lives?
                        
                    Over the past few months we’ve been talking with industry insiders on The Girls in Tech Podcast about how they envision the future of tech across various industries, and we’ve walked away with some interesting insights.
